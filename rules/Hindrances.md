# Hindrance-tracks:

There are 5 tracks of mental obstacles, counting the collective usage of each associated subjects. There are many obstacles which could be named, but these five major ones are especially important as they block and clutter the road to personal and spiritual progress:
- sensual desires
- ill-will
- sloth and torpor
- restlesness and remorse
- sceptical doubt

## Play method

By playing cards, our minds are subject to various effects produced by the event, by their costs or results. For the card cost, player places a cube on top of each track. Similarly, the result means cubes to be removed from bottom of the tracks. 
Cards having ‘next turn’ remoark attached to the hindrance icons (in the result box) will be solved on the players next turn. If there are no more turns available within round, their cube-removals should be solved at the next round (if available). For marking you can put a cube of players color on top of it and resolve the cards effects later in their turn. 

## setup and round end summarization

On setup players having karmic cards adds cubes onto the named tracks.

On end of each round (after playing out all possible cards) summarization of hindrances occurs:
Count cubes on each track
Leave 1 cube for each player having the most cubes on a track
On a tie, every player who share the tie leaves a cube on the track
All other cubes go back to the players repositories
Players, who have 3+ cubes on different tracks at this point receive a cube onto their Dukkha track.
Players having unresolved karmic cards adds cubes onto the named tracks on begin of each round.
